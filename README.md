# classify-signals-from-outer-space-using-keras

The data  consists of 2D spectrograms of deep space radio signalsðŸŒŒ collected by the Allen Telescope ArrayðŸ”­ at the SETI Institute.

We will treat the spectrograms as images to train an image classification model to classify the signals into one of four classes ("squiggle", "narrowband", "noise", "narrowbanddrd").ðŸŒŸ

This project uses `CNN` to classify the signals.

tool : Keras with TensorFlow as its backend.
